# 🎃 Horror Movie Subgenre Classification

## Problem: 
Imagine trying to choose a Horror Movie with your friends. Does *Saw* come to mind? Or maybe *The Conjuring*, *28 Days Later*, or *Get Out*? These films might give you chills, but beyond that, they're vastly different. So, how can you predict what awaits you without more precise categorisation?

In a world where horror movies span countless themes and styles, the challenge lies in crafting a meaningful movie-watching experience. 

## 🎯 A More Tailored Scare:
**How can we give you a better fright using data?**

### 💡 The Solution:
The key lies in leveraging data-driven techniques like **K-means clustering** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. By analyzing IMDb movie descriptions, we aim to uncover hidden connections and patterns within the horror genre.

### 🎬 Our Goal:
To create a more refined and accurate classification of horror movie subgenres. This approach empowers filmmakers, studios, and audiences with deeper insights, transforming how we appreciate and enjoy horror cinema.

Through this project, we're on a journey to make horror movie categorization not just scarier, but smarter.
